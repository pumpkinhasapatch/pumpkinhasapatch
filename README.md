### Hey mate, I'm pumpkin. ðŸŽƒ ðŸ¤“

I have spent a lot of my spare time as a kid studying and using the block-based visual programming environment [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) since I first got introduced to version 1.4 in a fourth-grade computer class at school.

As I grew older, learned a lot of the wizardry behind Scratch and saw almost everything the platform had to offer, I decided to expand my work out into the real-world and create new tools and extensions based around the original concepts of Scratch that other people might find useful.

ðŸŽ® You can probably find me on that "[unmoderated chat app](https://ocular.jeffalo.net/search?q=unmoderated%20chat)" that both starts and ends with the letter 'd' at the same username as my GitHub, maybe in the Sat-on Add-ons or TurboWarp community server. (Say the word and evil kumquats will come and eat all your energy units)
